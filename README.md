# Any2c GUI

Any2c (formerly Raw2c, hence the filenames) is a GUI utility to convert any file into "byte data" that can be used in any C or C++ application. It supports multiple files and can export both .c sources and .h include files.

With only using the default settings, the produced sources are typically 3x the original file size (for compressed files) but they can be much smaller or larger depending on the content.

Made with wxWidgets 2.8 and Code::Blocks (wxSmith plugin).
