# Any2c GUI

Any2c (formerly Raw2c, hence the filenames) is a GUI utility to convert files into byte data that can be used in C or C++ projects. It supports multiple files and can export .c sources and .h (declarations only) include files.

With the default settings, the produced files are typically 3x the original file size (for compressed files) but they can be much smaller (for text files) or larger depending on the content.

Developed using wxWidgets 3.0 and Code::Blocks (+ wxSmith plugin).
