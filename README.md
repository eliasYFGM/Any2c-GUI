Any2c (formerly Raw2c, hence the filenames) is a GUI utility to convert any file into "byte data" that can be used in any C or C++ project. It supports multiple files and can export both .c sources and .h include files.

Bytes can be exported as decimal (produces smaller files) or hexadecimal (fixed-size lines).

Made in wxWidgets 2.8 and Code::Blocks (wxSmith plugin).
